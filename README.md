# Genomic_and_Epigenetics_of_the_Brain
Course Project completed Fall 2021 at Carnegie Mellon

This project aims to 1) identify epigenetic regions that associate with evolution of different social group sizes in primates; 2) investigate its implications in schizophrenia. Predicted open chromatin level of each region that are present in the ATAC-seq data is kindly provided by Dr. Andreas Pfenning. Please read Final Report.docx for details of the project and conclusions 

- Files with names starting with ATACSeqAnalysis are the source code written to investigate the relationship between predicted open chromatin regions and social group size in six chosen primate species.
Note: ATACSeqAnalysis_ConvertToBED is in Python, while the others are in R.

- The txt files are genes associated with (likely regulated by) 400 predicted open chromatin regions that are most positively or negatively correlated with social group size. This is generated by GREAT
